This program uses Caesar Cipher, a well-known substitution cipher, to encrypt and decrypt files. 
Users can enter the name of the file they would like encrypted, and the program will produce a file containing the encrypted text. 
To decrypt files, users can run the same encrypted file through the program, and it will produce a new file containing the original, decrypted text.
